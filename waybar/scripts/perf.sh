# Three states, because platform_profile on its own is too coarse -- measured on
# this machine, the only things power-profiles-daemon changes are EPP
# (balance_performance -> performance) and Dell's EC fan curve. PL1, no_turbo and
# max_perf_pct are identical across all three profiles.
#
#   balanced  PPD balanced,    max_perf_pct 100   default, coolest
#   blend     PPD performance, max_perf_pct 85    fans up, clocks capped
#   turbo     PPD performance, max_perf_pct 100   nothing held back
#
# "blend" is the useful one on this chassis. It throttled for 149s of a 49min
# uptime while sitting at 92C with the fans at ~55%, so the top slice of boost is
# not actually reachable for any length of time. Raising the fan curve while
# capping the ceiling trades unreachable peak clock for higher sustained clock.
